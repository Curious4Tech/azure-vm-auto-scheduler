# azure-vm-auto-scheduler
Azure VM Auto-Scheduler is a serverless automation solution using Azure Functions to optimize cloud costs by automatically shutting down and starting VMs based on tagging. It ensures non-critical VMs are deallocated when idle and restarted when needed, using a timer trigger and managed identity authentication.
